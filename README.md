The React JS Custom Form GitHub repo is a project that demonstrates how to create a dynamic form using React. The form allows the user to input different types of data, such as text, numbers, and dates. It also includes validation to ensure that the user enters the correct data type and format. The form is designed to be reusable, meaning it can be easily customized and adapted for different applications. The project uses React hooks to manage the state of the form and handle user input. Additionally, it includes styling using CSS modules to make the form look professional and user-friendly. The repo includes detailed documentation and instructions on how to use and customize the form.
